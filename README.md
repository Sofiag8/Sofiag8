### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Sofiag8/Sofiag8** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently studying Fullstack Software Development with knowledge bases in Linux, data structures, algorithms, low-level programming languages, high-level modern languages, databases, APIs, and DevOps.

- 💻 My most recent project is about deploying my own server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. With some of the features but covering all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track at Holberton such as the creation of a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging), website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic, a database or files that store data amd an API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and the data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).
