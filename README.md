### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Fullstack Software Development with knowledge bases in Linux, data structures, algorithms, low-level programming languages, high-level modern languages, databases, APIs, and DevOps.

- ðŸ’» My most recent project is about deploying my own server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. With some of the features but covering all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track at Holberton such as the creation of a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging), website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic, a database or files that store data amd an API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and the data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).
